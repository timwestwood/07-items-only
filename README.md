# '07 Items Only
This is a RuneLite[^runelite] plugin for players who want to maximise their nostalgia and avoid items which have been added to Old School RuneScape[^osrs] (OSRS) since its initial release. By default this will include items from the original God Wars dungeon, but as this was actually added to the main game in 2007 and may be considered "old school" by many players, there is a toggle to allow such items.
