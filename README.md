# No New Items
No New Items is a RuneLite[^runelite] plugin for players who want to maximise their nostalgia by avoiding items which have been added to Old School RuneScape[^osrs] (OSRS) since its initial release. It does so by changing the visual appearance of new items to be bright red, acting as a visual warning. There is also an option to change the in-game name of new items.

By default, the plugin will consider items from the original God Wars dungeon and the armour reward from the easy Varrock diary as new because they weren't present in the game at the time of the backup used to create OSRS. But as these were actually added to the main game in 2007 and may be considered "old school" by many players, there is a toggle to allow such items. Similarly, the plugin will default to recolouring:
- the coin pouches from pickpocketing that replaced coins as part of an update to tackle botting/autoclicking;
- the stackable, tier-specific reward caskets from clue scrolls that replaced the original reward caskets;
- the bird nests containing seeds (both the standard type and those from Wyson) that replaced the old seed nests when the drop tables were updated;
- the updated Agility cape and Agility cape (t), which now function as the graceful cape;
- Old School bonds, which players may rely on for their membership;

but these can be toggled too.

## Examples

- Some game items, such as fishing nets, are drawn using texture files rather than being coloured in. For these items, the usual texture is replaced with red and pink lava to give a similar effect.
