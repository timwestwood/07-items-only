# No New Items
This is a RuneLite[^runelite] plugin for players who want to maximise their nostalgia and avoid items which have been added to Old School RuneScape[^osrs] (OSRS) since its initial release. It does so by changing the visual appearance of new items to be bright red, acting as a visual warning. There is also an option to change the in-game name of new items.

By default, the plugin will consider items from the original God Wars dungeon and the armour reward from the easy Varrock diary as new. But as these were actually added to the main game in 2007 and may be considered "old school" by many players, there is a toggle to allow such items.
